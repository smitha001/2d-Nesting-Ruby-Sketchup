# 2d-Nesting-Ruby-Sketchup
my Attempt at 2d concave polygon nesting in ruby within Sketchup

This is early days.

I've got the following issues:
1. I need to put more work to placing one polygon completely inside the outline of another
2. I know this isn't going to be fast. It's interpretted and I'm not a ruby expert, so I'm probably writting slow code.
